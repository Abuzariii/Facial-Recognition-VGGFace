# Facial-Recognition-VGGFace

VGG Face is a dataset of 2.6 million face images of 2,622 people that is used for the development facial recognition technology. The development of VGG Face dataset was supported by United States Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (IARPA).

In these expreiments I built a Convolutional Neural Network with 16 Convolutional Layers, One CNN Layer is followed by a Zero Padding Layer and then the next CNN layer is followed by a Max Pooling Layer.

The number of filters in CNN layers started from 64 in the first layer to 4096 filters in the last layer.

The model was then loaded with pretrained weights found [here.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1CPSeum3HpopfomUEK1gybeuIVoeJT_Eo/view?usp=sharing)
